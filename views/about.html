   <article>Pierre et Gilles are two French artists who collaborate on hand-painted photographs. Pierre Commoy, born 1950 in La Roche-sur-Yon, France is the man behind the lens and his romantic partner, Gilles Blanchard, born 1953 in Le Havre, France adds his unique aesthetic adornments that frame each shot. Specializing in portraits of celebrities like Madonna as well as fashion models, the duo create images that mix reality, daily life, dreams, and fantasies.
